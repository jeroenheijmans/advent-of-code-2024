## Running

Prerequisite: [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
Also make sure there is a `dayXX.txt` file next to each spec with your puzzle input.

```sh
bun test --watch
```

or one specific day:

```sh

```

## Lessons

Here's what I learned (or noticed) each day.

1. Intellisense is more important than I thought.
2. Gotta take your time!
3. Copilot for AoC can be no fun.
4. There shall be **no** premature optimization!
5. Saving intermediate but wrong steps helps!
6. Sometimes the first part is easy.
7. Sometimes the hard part comes first.
8. Avoiding math *can* be useful.
9. Be glad that smart folks write (de)fragmenters.
10. If you understand the lesson, stop here; otherwise, see lesson 10.
11. You've got to memoize important things!
12. Take a bit of luck if you can catch it.
13. Listen to your Math teacher, kids!
14. Don't solve part 2 until you know what part 2 is.
15. Always check input and output carefully.
